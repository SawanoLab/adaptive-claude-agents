## 🚧 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Not Enough Alpha Testers
- **Mitigation**: Recruit from lab members first, then Claude Code community
- **Fallback**: Conduct internal testing with 2-3 lab members

### Risk 2: Critical Bugs Found During Testing
- **Mitigation**: Reserve Day 6 entirely for bug fixes
- **Fallback**: Delay public beta by 2-3 days if needed

### Risk 3: Platform Compatibility Issues
- **Mitigation**: Test on all platforms before alpha testing
- **Fallback**: Release macOS/Linux first, Windows WSL later

### Risk 4: Documentation Unclear
- **Mitigation**: Ask testers to flag confusing sections
- **Fallback**: Conduct live demo session to clarify
