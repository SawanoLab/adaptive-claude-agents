2. **Create a new directory**: `templates/your-stack/`
3. **Add template files**:
   - `tester.md` - Testing subagent
   - `reviewer.md` - Code review subagent (if applicable)
   - `README.md` - Template documentation
4. **Update detection logic** in `skills/project-analyzer/detect_stack.py`
5. **Add examples** in `examples/your-stack/`
6. **Test thoroughly**

#### Template Requirements

- Must include clear description and purpose
- Must specify required tools
- Must include usage examples
- Must follow existing template format
- Must be tested with a real project

By submitting a template, you agree to:
- License it under MIT
